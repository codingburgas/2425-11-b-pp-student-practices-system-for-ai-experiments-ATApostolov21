# Supabase Authentication Setup Guide

## Problem Identified
Your authentication issues stem from Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) policies, which are preventing:
- Anonymous users from inserting new records (registration)
- Reading user data for login verification
- Updating and deleting user records

## Solution: SQL Setup in Supabase

### Step 1: Access your Supabase Project
1. Log in to Supabase at https://app.supabase.co/
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to the SQL Editor

### Step 2: Run the SQL Setup Script
1. Open a new SQL query
2. Copy and paste the entire contents of the `setup_supabase.sql` file into the editor
3. Click "Run" to execute the SQL

This will:
- Create the users table if it doesn't exist
- Enable appropriate Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Create SQL functions that bypass RLS for specific operations

### Step 3: Verify Setup
To verify the setup was successful:
1. Navigate to the "Table Editor" in Supabase
2. Select the "users" table
3. Check that the table structure matches what you see in the SQL script
4. Navigate to "Authentication" â†’ "Policies" to confirm the RLS policies were created

## What Has Been Fixed in Your Code

### 1. User Model Changes
- Added RPC function calls to bypass RLS policies
- Added error handling for all Supabase operations
- Ensured proper handling of UUIDs

### 2. SQL Setup
- Created the users table with the correct structure
- Added RLS policies that allow the necessary operations
- Created SQL functions with SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS

### 3. Authentication Flow
- Registration should now create new users in Supabase
- Login should successfully retrieve user data
- Profile updates and deletions should work

## Testing Your Authentication

After completing the SQL setup, you should test:

1. User Registration
   - Try registering a new user
   - Check the users table in Supabase to confirm the user was created

2. User Login
   - Try logging in with the user you created
   - Verify you can access protected routes after login

3. User Profile Management
   - Test updating user information
   - Test deleting a user account

If you encounter further issues, check the Flask server logs for specific errors.
